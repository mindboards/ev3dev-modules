/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every ev3dev_xx module has its own static copy of the ev3_device
 * structure. If this is the first ev3dev compatible module to load then
 * this module is responsible for creating the device node.
 *
 * When an ev3dev_xx module loads a check is made for the "ev3dev" platform
 * device node. If that node does not exist, then the "ev3dev" platform
 * device is registered.
 *
 * The ev3dev module must register the xx device as a child of the ev3dev
 * device, and then register any additional instances of subdevices or
 * device attributes.
 *
 * The result is a tree that looks like this, for example:
 *
 * sys/devices/platform/ev3dev/pwm/motorA
 *                                /motorB 
 *
 * Key functions that make this work: device_find_child()
 *                                    device foreach child()
 *
 * The ev3dev_release function is responsible for cleaning up the 
 * ev3dev entry when the last module is unloaded.
